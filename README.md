# Base Algorithms for sorting 𝒮ℌ𝒜𝒦ℰ𝒮𝒫ℰ𝒜ℛℰ  's work 

The following solution provides implementation for 3 Base algorithms, which sort Shakespeare's work from a text file.

## Features
- Read Shakespeare's work from a text file. 📖
  - Process the text to **lower case** and **without any punctuation**.
- Algorithms used: 🧮
  - Insertion Sort
  - Selection Sort
  - Merge Sort
- Outputting the time consumption ⏱ for each algorithm and an alphabetically sorted word array 

### Starting the program ▶️
- Clone the project through `git clone https://github.com/davi7725/Algorithms_Assignment1.git` or just download it as a ZIP file
- Open the project into an IDE that supports   <img src="https://waffleio-direct-uploads-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/5b631124103d580013dcf6a4/125516c66e82c728ace21e0d46b9c6ca73929be4a5e8a9429b4de29b2e54267e240dad2c4f89e226b8577a060a3012f316074107baae9b37b4f67e2fd00958a9c3674d71946818a4ead31ab907b826d94685b7b4dc4894be3c77e599935d7c4f5b4cd6a2047ff5db59c24af742eb4c50a1133462e477327c40941a6761.png" height="50">    applications
- Change file path in [Main.java](https://github.com/davi7725/Algorithms_Assignment1/blob/9fdd4a3a62e0165d0f6c28384cf797044385c813/src/main/java/com/cphbusiness/basicalgorithms/Main.java#L31) to the path of your [dataset](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datsoftlyngby/soft2019spring-algorithms/master/Weeklies/Week_05/Assignment_01/Shakespeare_Complete_Works.txt)
- Start the application by running the *Main* file

_NB❗️you can download the Shakespeare's works from the hyperlink attached to the word **dataset**_

_⚠️ Be aware that it will take some time to load the full dataset, therefore coffee ☕️ or tea 🍵 break is advisable_
